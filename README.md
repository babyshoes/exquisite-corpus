# exquisite-corpus

A work-in-progress poetry game designed for writing collaborative works with people on the web.

The game is simple: one person writes two lines to start a poem. The next person writes two more lines given only the last
line that came before. This goes on until one person decides that their lines end the poem, at which point everyone involved
can read the result. The only rule is that the same user can't take a turn twice in a row, though more advanced forms of play
are still to come.

Adapted from Angular2-Meteor boilerplate, this project uses Angular2 and Typescript for the front-end components. Meteor is
used to interact with the Mongo database asynchronously.
